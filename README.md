# Pisan's Restaurant
***

*Description*
This project is for users to make reservations to the restaraunt and for the admin to be able to track the name, size of party, date, and time of the reservation being made.
***

*Future Changes*
I would like to have the "Reservation Made" alert be a modal. I would also like to have the admin page linked to the main page for the login and register forms.
